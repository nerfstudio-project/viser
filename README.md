Viser is a 3D visualization library for computer vision and robotics in Python.

Features include:

- API for visualizing 3D primitives.
- GUI building blocks: buttons, checkboxes, text inputs, sliders, etc.
- Scene interaction tools (clicks, selection, transform gizmos).
- Programmatic camera control and rendering.
- An entirely web-based client, for easy use over SSH!

The goal is to provide primitives that are (1) easy for simple visualization tasks, but (2) can be composed into more elaborate interfaces. For more about design goals, see the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22885).

Examples and documentation: https://viser.studio

## Installation

You can install `viser` with `pip`:

```bash
pip install viser            # Core dependencies only.
pip install viser[examples]  # To include example dependencies.
```

That's it! To learn more, we recommend looking at the examples in the [documentation](https://viser.studio/).
