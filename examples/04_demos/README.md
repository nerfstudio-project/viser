# Demo Applications

Complete, real-world applications showcasing viser's capabilities with external tools and datasets.

## Examples in this directory:

- **00_record3d_visualizer.py** - Visualizing Record3D captures (iPhone depth data)
- **01_realsense.py** - Live visualization from Intel RealSense cameras
- **02_colmap_visualizer.py** - Structure-from-Motion reconstruction viewer
- **03_urdf_visualizer.py** - Robot model visualization from URDF files
- **04_smpl_visualizer.py** - Human body model visualization (SMPL)
- **05_smpl_skinned.py** - Advanced skinned mesh animation

## What you'll learn:

1. Integrating viser with external data sources
2. Working with real-world file formats
3. Building complete visualization applications
4. Handling complex data pipelines
5. Domain-specific visualization techniques

## External dependencies:

These examples may require additional packages:
- **Record3D**: For iPhone depth capture data
- **RealSense**: Intel RealSense SDK for live camera data
- **COLMAP**: Structure-from-Motion datasets
- **URDF**: Robot description files
- **SMPL**: Human body model data

## Use cases:

- Robotics visualization and debugging
- Computer vision research
- 3D reconstruction workflows
- Human motion analysis
- Mixed reality applications

## Getting started:

Each demo includes download scripts for sample data in the `../assets/` directory.
Check the individual file headers for specific setup instructions.

## Next steps:

These demos combine concepts from:
- `../01_scene/` for 3D rendering
- `../02_gui/` for user controls  
- `../03_interaction/` for user input
