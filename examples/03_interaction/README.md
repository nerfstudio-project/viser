# Interaction Examples

Learn how to make your 3D scenes interactive and responsive to user input.

## Examples in this directory:

- **00_click_meshes.py** - Detecting clicks on 3D objects
- **01_scene_pointer.py** - Mouse interaction and scene navigation
- **02_get_renders.py** - Capturing and processing scene renders
- **03_games.py** - Interactive games and applications

## What you'll learn:

1. Mouse and click event handling
2. Scene picking and object selection
3. Real-time user interaction patterns
4. Building interactive applications
5. Capturing and using render data

## Key concepts:

- **Event handlers**: Respond to mouse clicks and movements
- **Scene picking**: Identify which objects the user clicked
- **Render capture**: Get images and data from your scene
- **Game loops**: Structure for interactive applications

## Use cases:

- Object selection and manipulation
- Interactive data exploration
- Educational simulations
- Games and entertainment
- Annotation and labeling tools
