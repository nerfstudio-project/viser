""":mod:`viser.infra` provides WebSocket-based communication infrastructure.

We implement abstractions for:
- Launching a WebSocket+HTTP server on a shared port.
- Registering callbacks for connection events and incoming messages.
- Asynchronous message sending, both broadcasted and to individual clients.
- Defining dataclass-based message types.
- Translating Python message types to TypeScript interfaces.

These are what `viser` runs on under-the-hood, and generally won't be useful unless
you're building a web-based application from scratch.
