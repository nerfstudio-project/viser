# Important: in the ./.github/workflows/publish.yml action, we have sed
# commands that assume the `viser = ...` line below directly follows
# `[tool.setuptools.package-data]`. We use this to remove the client source
# from PyPI builds.
#
# We should make sure that any modifications to the package-data list remain
# compatible with the sed commands!
#
# We keep the client source in by default to support things like pip
# installation via the Git URL, because build artifacts aren't
# version-controlled.
